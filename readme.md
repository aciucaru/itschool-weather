Simple weather app made for homework.
Technologies used:
- HTML
- CSS
- vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks used)
- JavaScript's fetch() function to get weather data from [openweathermap.org](https://openweathermap.org/) external endpoint
- JavaScript promises in order to use loaded weather data only when needed
